###Birds 2018 --> change dataset ID and version
#From Cornelia: to make the dataset 25306 "Bird survey and trait data on all grassland and forest EPs 2018" public, 
#we had to upload the data in a new dataset. This dataset (31521) contains abbreviations for the observer. All other 
#data is identical. Dataset 25306 was deleted. I updated the link section of your dataset - I deleted the link to 25306 
#and added a link to  31521 in your synthesis dataset (27706, 27707, 31206) and dataset 31368."

#HEW51 has zeros (and not NAs) for birds before 2017! check this for all groups and change
